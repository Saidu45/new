# Mechanical Engineering Course Website

## Overview
This project is a simple static website designed for a Mechanical Engineering Course, featuring an assignment response about health and nutrition, specifically foods to avoid when managing obesity. The website uses HTML and CSS to present the content in a clean, professional, and responsive layout.

## Purpose
The website serves as an educational resource to display assignment answers related to health and nutrition, styled to align with a professional course website. It includes a list of foods to avoid for obesity management and reasons for avoiding five of them.

## File Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the website structure, including a header, main content, and lists for the assignment answers.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the website with a modern, responsive design, including typography, layout, and visual effects.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone this repository or download the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`) to your local machine.
2. **Place Files in a Directory**:
   - Ensure `index.html` and `style.css` are in the same directory for the CSS to link correctly.
3. **Open the Website**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the website.
   - No additional dependencies or server setup are required, as this is a static website.

## Usage
- The website displays a header with the title "Mechanical Engineering Course Resources."
- The main content includes an assignment section listing ten foods to avoid for obesity management and reasons for avoiding five of them.
- The design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
- To modify content, edit `index.html`. To adjust styling, update `style.css`.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<ul>` for better structure and accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout and font sizes for mobile devices (below 600px).
- **Clean Styling**: Features a white card layout with blue accents, shadows, and readable typography.
- **Linked CSS**: The `style.css` file is linked to `index.html` for consistent styling.

## Notes
- The website title suggests a mechanical engineering focus, but the content is health-related. To align the theme with mechanical engineering, update the content in `index.html` or request additional styling.
- The reasons for avoiding foods were added based on general nutritional knowledge, as they were not provided in the original assignment.
- For enhancements (e.g., navigation bar, footer, or interactive elements), refer to the project's issue tracker or contact the developer.
